# walk_app

The goal of this project is to create an application that visualizes walkability for station areas represented in any GTFS feed kept in the OpenMobilityDatabase. 

Walkability for this project is measured not by travel time by but by the netmeasured by network geography and how direct the access to station is for the land within the station area, defined here as a half mile buffer.
